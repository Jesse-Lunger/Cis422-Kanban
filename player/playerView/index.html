    <!--This is the screen players are supposed to be on
    for a majority of the time

    This screen should display the initialization list
    
    The minimum requirement of this page is to display the
    initList on the page so that players know whose turn it is

    A desired aesthetic is to have a "slurping" view to display
    the previous, current, and next player turns

    Another desired aesthetic is that initList should appear
    as a list of all fighters to one of the margins

    For now, the player sees the same as what the DM sees
    they shouldn't be able to interact with anything
    but I'm having trouble doing that
