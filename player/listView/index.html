    <!--This is the screen players are supposed to be on
    for a majority of the time

    This screen should display the initialization list
    
    The minimum requirement of this page is to display the
    initList on the page so that players know whose turn it is

    A desired aesthetic is to have a "slurping" view to display
    the previous, current, and next player turns

    Another desired aesthetic is that initList should appear
    as a list of all fighters to one of the margins

        <!--This display will ultimately use the kanban
        columns to display the initList I imagine
    
        I can't imagine how the backend'll organize this, but
        I'll make a framework for them to work with-->
